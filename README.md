Port of [Manoloide's Mantel](https://www.behance.net/gallery/62172035/mantel) from processing to p5.js.  Original processing version is taken from [Manolide's github repository](https://github.com/manoloide/AllSketchs/tree/master/2018/Generativos/mantel) and is also archived here.

There are two versions - the version in classic.html / mantel1.js is based directly
on the original processing code. The second version in index.html / mantel.js is
slightly reworked so that the screen shows the drawing being built up incrementally,
but is believed to otherwise be functionally identical to the original.

Mouse press restarts the program.

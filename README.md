A port of the generator used for [Manolo Gamboa Naon's Mantel](https://www.behance.net/gallery/62172035/mantel) from processing to p5.js.  Original processing version is taken from [Manolo's github repository](https://github.com/manoloide/AllSketchs/tree/master/2018/Generativos/mantel) and is also archived here.

An initial port resulted directly from the original processing code produced the version in classic.html / mantel1.js. Subsequent revisions were done by @dribnet so that the screen shows the drawing being built up incrementally. Manolo also provided feedback and guidance and the repo also includes the commit history of all changes.
